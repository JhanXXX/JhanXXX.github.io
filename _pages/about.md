## About Me

I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Transport and Geoinformation Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I completed my Bachelor's degree in [Civil Engineering](https://civileng.tongji.edu.cn/civilengen/main.htm) (track: Geotechnical Engineering) at [Tongji University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University), where I also undertook a one-year German language program and completed a minor in Artificial Intelligence. Outside of academics, I'm also a dancer with experience in choreography and freestyle battles.
