## About Me

I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Transport and Geoinformation Technology at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering (track: Geotechnical Engineering) at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), where I also undertook a one-year German language program and completed a minor in Artificial Intelligence. Outside of academics, I'm a dancer with experience in choreography and freestyle battles.
