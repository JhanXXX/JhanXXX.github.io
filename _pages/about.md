## About Me

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Transport and Geoinformation Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (2024-2026). I completed my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at Tongji University (2019-2024), where I also undertook a one-year German language program and completed a minor in Artificial Intelligence. Outside of academics, I am a freestyle dancer.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to exciting and challenging research projects related to transportation as a PhD student.

## Selected Projects
### Public Transport Performance Propagation Analysis
*Course Project | Sep 2025 - Oct 2025*

A causal inference methodology-based data experiment to analyze how service performance patterns (punctuality vs. regularity) propagate through Stockholm's multi-route bus network. 60+ days of GTFS operational data using PyKoda were processed. Propensity score analysis were implemented to estimate conditional associations while controlling for confounding factors.


### An AI-Based Automated Green Path Navigator & Green View Database
*Course Project | Sep 2025 - Oct 2025*

A full-stack Web GIS application that transforms academic GeoAI research into a practical urban planning tool. Equipped with a pre-trained model, this platform automatedly estimates Green View Index from satellite imagery for specified locations and dates. A green-aware route planner was implemented using PostgreSQL/PostGIS for data management, visualization and network analysis, integrating Stockholm’s public transit API to recommend real-time optimal walking/bus routes based on user-defined time-greenery weight preferences. Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Python (FastAPI, PyTorch), PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Docker, Mapbox GL JS, Microsoft Planetary Computer APIs, GTFS/Real-time Transit APIs.


### Cross-City Generalizable Green View Index Estimation from Satellite Imagery
*Individual Research Project | Jun 2025 - Oct 2025 | Supervisor: Yancheng Ling; Zhenliang Ma*

A satellite-based urban greenery assessment system using eight interpretable Sentinel-2 indices and CNN models to estimate street-level Green View Index across 19 European cities without requiring street-view imagery. The approach achieved R² values over 65% on unseen cities with 20m resolution input, with PCA clustering revealing distinct urban typologies and gradient-based attention analysis uncovering that model complexity must be balanced against overfitting to city-specific features for robust cross-geographic transferability.
